These technologies allow for precise visualization and control of dynamic cellular processes, but their effective application often requires specialized expertise. Our core offers consultation on biosensor selection, imaging protocols, and experimental design, maintains a repository of validated biosensors, and assists with custom biosensor design and optimization. In collaboration with UCSD microscopy facilities, we also provide training in quantitative imaging techniques and data analysis. By addressing technical challenges and sharing expertise, the core aims to enable researchers from diverse fields to integrate biosensors into their work with greater ease and rigor.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </>\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;"],"names":["_jsx","_Fragment","children","_jsxs","className","content","content_default"],"sourceRoot":""}
